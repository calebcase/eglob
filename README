EGLOB - Extended Globbing

An extension of the POSIX glob(...) function to support the star-star operator: '**'. The star-star operator will expand into any number of directory segments '/*' in order to acheive a match. For example:

/usr/**/*.so.*

Is equivalent to:

/usr/lib*/*.so.*
/usr/lib*/*/*.so.*
/usr/lib*/*/*/*.so.*
...

Another example would be to find all the jpeg files under your home directory:

~/**/*.jpeg

This use is mainly a shorthand for using the find utility and has a similar effect to:

$ find ~ -name \*.jpeg

It greatly simplifies searches involving a trailing directory structure:

/usr/**/bin/*

Which will find all the files under a bin directory regardless of whether they are in /usr/bin, /usr/lib/bin, /usr/lib*/bin, /usr/lib/app/lib/bin, etc. The equivalent find command requires matching with a regex on the path itself.

The star-star operator is inspired by the paper FCGlob: A New SELinux File Context Syntax by Don Miner and James Athey: http://www.tresys.com/pdf/FCGlob-A-New-Syntax.pdf
